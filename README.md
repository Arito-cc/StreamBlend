🎬 Project Description
StreamBlend is an interactive and responsive film discovery web application that mimics a contemporary streaming site. It is developed with React on the frontend and combined with the OMDb API so that users can browse, search, and filter films based on genre and ratings.

Though the backend stack (Express, MongoDB, Node.js) is left open for future enhancements (such as user authentication or watchlists), the project now shows complete mastery of API consumption, UI frameworks, and client-side routing with React Router.
